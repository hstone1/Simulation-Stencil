## How to run the simulator
./simulation <mesh_file> [optional speed factor] [optional --render <frame directory>]

examples:
./simulation example-meshes/cube.mesh						# Likely to explode
./simulation example-meshes/cube.mesh 0.1					# Slower simulation will not explode
./simulation example-meshes/ellipsoid 0.1 --render output/frames		# Expects output/frames to already exist


## Features Implemented
 - Surface Mesh Extraction 			(See simulation.cpp)
 - Gravity Force 				(See ParticleSystem::computeAcceleration)
 - Internal Elastic Forces 			(See ParticleSystem::computeAcceleration and ParticleSystem::ParticleSystem)
 - Collision Penalty Resolution 		(See ParticleSystem::computeAcceleration and collider.cpp SphereCollider::dirToOutside)
 - Viscous damping forces			(See ParticleSystem::computeAcceleration)
 - RK5 Simulation Integration			(See Integrator::step)
 - Push (Z) and Pull (X) Controls		(See View.cpp and Integrator::step && geometry::rayTriangleIntersect)


## Videos
Videos are for the most part rendered in blender using a custom script to import each mesh.

results/ellipsoid.mp4 		shows basic ellipsoid behavior
results/sphere.mp4		shows sphere with push / pull
results/tug.mp4			shows ellipsoid with push / pull
push_pull2.mp4			shows actual UI usage
